## Technical Architecture

### File Upload Flow

1. **Small Files (<5MB)**: Direct multipart upload to `/mail/attachments`
2. **Large Files (≥5MB)**: Pre-signed multipart upload workflow
   - Initialize upload session via `/mail/attachments/init`
   - Upload chunks to S3 with pre-signed URLs
   - Complete upload via `/mail/attachments/complete`

### Virus Scanning

- Simulated virus scanning with configurable scan times
- Status tracking: `pending` → `scanning` → `safe`/`infected`
- UI feedback during scan process
- Infected file handling with user notification

### State Management

- TanStack Query for server state and optimistic updates
- React state for local UI state
- Proper error boundaries and rollback strategies
- Auto-save with debouncing for drafts

## Database Requirements

### New Tables Needed

```sql
-- Upload sessions for pre-signed multipart uploads
CREATE TABLE upload_sessions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  draft_id UUID REFERENCES drafts(id),
  filename VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  mime_type VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  total_size BIGINT NOT NULL,
  upload_id VARCHAR(255), -- S3 upload ID
  status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'pending',
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  expires_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW() + INTERVAL '1 hour'
);

-- Enhanced attachments table
ALTER TABLE attachments ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS scan_status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'pending';
ALTER TABLE attachments ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS scan_result TEXT;
ALTER TABLE attachments ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS upload_session_id UUID REFERENCES upload_sessions(id);
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# File upload limits
MAX_ATTACHMENT_SIZE=20971520          # 20MB in bytes
MAX_CHUNK_SIZE=5242880               # 5MB chunk size
VIRUS_SCAN_TIMEOUT=30000             # 30 seconds

# Undo send settings
UNDO_SEND_WINDOW=10000               # 10 seconds

# S3 settings (for pre-signed uploads)
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
S3_BUCKET=ceerion-attachments
S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key
S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key
```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
