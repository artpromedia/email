# Email Deliverability Guide

Ensuring your emails reach the inbox is crucial for effective communication. This guide covers best practices for maintaining excellent deliverability rates.

## Understanding Email Deliverability

Email deliverability is the ability to deliver emails to recipients' inboxes rather than spam folders. It depends on several factors:

### Key Metrics

- **Delivery Rate**: Percentage of emails that reach the recipient's server
- **Inbox Placement**: Percentage of delivered emails that reach the inbox
- **Bounce Rate**: Percentage of emails that couldn't be delivered
- **Spam Rate**: Percentage of emails marked as spam

## Authentication Protocols

### SPF (Sender Policy Framework)

SPF helps prevent email spoofing by verifying that emails come from authorized servers:

```dns
v=spf1 include:_spf.ceerion.com ~all
```

### DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)

DKIM adds a digital signature to your emails:

- Cryptographically signs outgoing emails
- Verifies message integrity
- Reduces spoofing and tampering

### DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication)

DMARC builds on SPF and DKIM to provide additional protection:

- Prevents domain spoofing
- Provides feedback on authentication failures
- Helps maintain sender reputation

## Content Best Practices

### Subject Lines

- Keep under 50 characters for mobile optimization
- Avoid spam trigger words (FREE, URGENT, etc.)
- Personalize when appropriate
- Test different variations

### Email Content

- Maintain a good text-to-image ratio
- Include an unsubscribe link
- Use clean, professional HTML
